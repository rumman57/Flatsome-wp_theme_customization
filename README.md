## How To Run Source Code

First you have to download whole project source code.Then create a Database. 

Open Source Code.Go to Database Folder , open 'woocommerce1.sql' from any texteditor. Next open readme.txt and copy the text. Then 'replace all' this  text from woocommerce1.sql to 'path where you keep your source code'. 

Example:  http://localhost/wptestsite ===> replace all ===> http://rh-rumman/wordpress/flatsome

Now go to phpmyadmin & select your database. Import this sql file.

Put your code to your exact location.

Open "wp-config.php". Change DB_NAME,DB_USER & DB_PASSWORD as you set.

**Admin Panel : Username => 'rumman' & Password => 'rumman57'**

Now,Go to Database Folder. Open 'themeoptions.txt' file & copy the text. 

Now , Go to Dashboard->Appearance->Theme Options->Backup and Import.Paste the text into textarea box and click save all changes.

Go to Appearance->Menus. From top,in a 'select to menu edit option' select the "header menu(main menu)".Then from below in 'Menu Settings'->Theme Location->check the 'Main Menu' and Save Menu.
